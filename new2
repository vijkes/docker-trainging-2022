Docker behind the scene lauch the process in that we can lauch multiple proccesses that is the reason why docker is fast

whenever we launch container in iteractive mode docker gives terminal bcz behind scene it is running bash shell

in container , root dir is linked with / drive and data in / drive comes from image, not from base sys

data in /drive comes from image, that is reason if a container is running and we try to remove container, it gives error
