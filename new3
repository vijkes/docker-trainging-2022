Raft consensus algorithm is protocol that docker master uses to share the info
and this decides fault tolrance.
 

Master node is to manage the thing,
running the container is done by worker nodes

State is generally decided by leader(first master)

(N-1)/2
here N is no. of master nodes.
so we should have min. 3 master nodes.

Leader means master is active
Reacheable means it is passive master
Brain is always used by leader node.

we can convert master node to worker node and vice-versa this is called
promotion or demotion


don't give leader work of worker node, if it start using resources it might slow down.
so we should cluster master only node. and not as a worker

so we drain that node
as a result in future all the running process stops in that node

docker stack needs pre-build image unlike docker-compose.

docker swarm join-token manager

docker service update --replicas=5 mypyapp_web

docker node  promote ip-172-31-34-92.us-east-2.compute.internal

docker node update --availability drain ip-172-31-47-13.us-east-2.compute.internal
